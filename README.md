# Mortgage Calculator API

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and built with TypeScript.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mortgage-calculator-api.git
cd mortgage-calculator-api
```

## Getting Started

Install your packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application running.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
